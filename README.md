SNHU CS-305 Module 8-1 Journal Assignment

The client for this projct was Artemis Financial. They are a financial
constulting company that helps develope financial personalized fiancial
plans for individuals. They produce many different types of financial 
plans. Artemis Financial is aiming to modernize their business and 
utilize more software. They are seeking to improve their security and
implement more measures to keep their business secure.

I believe my integration of the OWASP Depency check tool was something I 
did very well. I believe I have become familiar with using this tool and 
can properly implement and utilize this code well and it was done well in
this report. Its critical to build code securly primarily for the safety 
of the users or customers. There privacy and safety needs to secure and 
this must be handled responsibly. Additionally the companys trust among
consumers will be completely tarnished and ruined.

I found the self certificate generation the most difficult. I still dont 
have a full grasp of it and some aspects about it is a little confusing. 
Im sure I will get better with time and practice. I also believe there
is much I got to learn with certifications as a whole still. 

I increased layers of security by implementing a hash function cipher,
implmeneting a self generated self certificate and utilizing the OWASP
Dependency check tool. This all stregnthened the system overall and 
offered their own unique angle.

To ensure that my code was functional and secure I implemented some testing
methods. I utilized a lot of manuel testing and anazlyzed my code and 
associating documents to check if the logic was proper and all aspects were
consistent. I utilized the automated testing tool in the system to ensure if the 
code was running properly. I then reran the OWASP Dependency check tool
and anazlyzed the new report to check if there were any new vulnarabilities

There were many new tools that Ive been introduced to. Ive never used the OWASP 
Dependency check tool, The self generated certification, or implementing 
hashing functions at a level similar to this project. I can see these tools
being very helpful in specific situations and im glad to have these tools
within my skillset.

Id like to show employers the tools and features I implemented successfully within 
this project. I hope to show them that I have used these tools before and have some
familiarity with them.
